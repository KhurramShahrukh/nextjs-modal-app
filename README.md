## Next 15 app with the following key features:

- **Parallel Routes**: Uses `@modal` slot in the layout
- **Intercepting Routes**: `(.)products/[id]` intercepts navigation from `/products` page
- **Modal Component**: Uses HTML `<dialog>` element with proper a11y
- **Navigation Handling**: Browser back/forward works correctly
- **Direct URL Access**: URLs like `/products/1` work when accessed directly
- **Keyboard Support**: ESC key closes modal
- **Click Outside**: Clicking backdrop closes modal

This implementation provides a seamless modal experience while maintaining proper URL structure and browser navigation behavior.
